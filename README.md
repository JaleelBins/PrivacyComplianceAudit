# Privacy Compliance Audit Platform

A revolutionary blockchain-based platform that enables confidential compliance auditing using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. This platform ensures complete privacy of sensitive compliance data while maintaining transparency and accountability in regulatory assessments.

## üîê Core Concept

**Confidential Compliance Auditing with FHE Smart Contracts**

Traditional compliance auditing exposes sensitive organizational data during the assessment process. Our platform solves this critical privacy challenge by implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) directly within smart contracts, allowing compliance scores, risk assessments, and audit results to be processed while remaining completely encrypted.

### Key Innovation
- **Encrypted Computation**: All compliance scores and risk levels are computed on encrypted data
- **Zero Knowledge Disclosure**: Auditors can verify compliance without accessing raw sensitive data
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Immutable audit trails while maintaining data confidentiality
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Supports major frameworks including GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001
